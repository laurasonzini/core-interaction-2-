    <summary>WHO AM I?</summary>
    <div>
  My name is Laura. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on October 31, 2003. I spent my early childhood living 
  in the outskirts of Buenos Aires, surrounded by close friends and family. When I was 9 years old, my family
   decided to move to Miami, FL and start a new life in the United States. Although my life completely changed, 
   I grew to love the city of Miami and while preserving the emotional connection I had with Buenos Aires.<br><br>

   Ever since I was in diapers, my mother, a talented artist in the world of graphic design, would sit next to me and 
   provide me with pencils and crayons to entertain myself. These moments birthed my first ways to express my creativity. 
   Over the years, she has kept all of my drawings as evidence since I found it easier to communicate with colorful 
   shapes and strokes than with words. In high-school, I began applying this artistic vision to a number of different 
   artistic projects and digital explorations. I was quickly identified as the "artistic" friend, the one others 
   would go to when they needed creative advice or inspiration. <br><br>
   Today, I am studying communication design at Parsons School of Design, where I continue to nurture my passion 
   for creativity and visual expression. As I delve deeper into my studies, I aim to merge traditional techniques
    with modern technology, seeking innovative ways to communicate ideas and evoke emotions
    through design. 

    With each stroke of my pencil or click of my mouse, I am determined to carve out a distinctive path in the 
    world of design, driven by the desire to make meaningful connections and evoke emotions through my work.

    <summary>PERSONAL MISSION</summary>
    <div>
        Fueled by a passion for creativity and an unwavering dedication to excellence, my mission is to immerse 
        myself in the dynamic world of graphic design and branding. With a lifelong affinity for design and a 
        newfound passion for digital branding, I aspire to merge these two realms to create captivating visual 
        narratives. <br><br>
Inspired by the power of effective design, I am committed to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to projects 
that push boundaries and spark innovation. Drawing from my experiences as a working-class individual and a 
perfectionist, I understand the importance of balancing competence with genuine hospitality. Embracing the notion 
of "unreasonable hospitality" as articulated by Will Guidara, I strive to exceed expectations and create experiences 
that leave a lasting impression on clients, colleagues, and collaborators alike.
